# BubbleWitchIris
Bubble Witch Iris is a 2D roguelike shooter developed in Unity by team Eggcell. This game was developed as part of a rigorous 10 week course that included a competition of best game ranked by students. Bubble Witch Iris took second place overall. 

This repository is only meant to demonstrate all of the code written by myself and team members of Eggcell. Full source code for all object behaviors are included in "Scripts". Other files meant to support this project to be developed and tested in Unity are not included in this repository.
